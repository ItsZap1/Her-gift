        <p>Sahabia, I love you from the darkest corners of my heart. You are the most beautiful woman I've ever laid my eyes on. You rule my heart, you live in my heart, and always will, forever. I dreamt of taking you to a field of flowers and telling them how pretty you are, surely they are inferior to you. Lightning dances in your eyes, surely they struck me, and I drowned in your eyes. Some people fear the drowning depths, they try to get out, but I dwell in your ocean, built a little cottage in them, and found love in the waves. Your laughter echoes like mountain streams in my ears. Your smile rivals dawn's first light. Like a old fine wine, your allure deepens with time, drawing my heart closer in a sublime rhythm. To gaze upon you is to lose myself. Your sweetness defies simple comparisons, a taste beyond any known connotation. Mountains stand humbled, the moon bows in awe, your radiance shines without any flaws. Your fragrance whispers of roses and jasmines, yet your essence defies any known hymn. No dictionary could grasp you entirely, beyond articulation, unspoken. </p>
        <p>"It had flaws, but what does that matter when it comes to matter of the heart? We love what we love. Reason does not enter into it. In many ways, unwise love is the truest love. Anyone can love a thing because. That's as easy as putting a penny into your pocket. But to love something despite. To know the flaws and love them too. That is rare and pure and perfect."</p>
        <p>I will always love you Sahabia, I'll marry you, I'll make you mine in every way. I'll fulfill all your dreams. We have an eternity ahead of us. Happy birthday my Dulcinea. ❤️ </p>
